# Wildlife-Crossing
A life simulator game that takes heavy inspiration from Animal Crossing, Built in Godot 4.2.2

## Quick info
First up, check out the Wiki! that is where most of the internal systems are documented!

Next up, this game is in active development! so bugs are expected!

Goals of this project:
* Learn how games with a ton of Systems manage stuff
* Bring an Animal crossing like game to android and computer
* Make the game performant enough to not require loading screens!

and finally, I plan to get all of the main systems set in stone before releasing code, changing ALL of the 21 (and counting) systems can really make this game fall apart fast!
